1 Advanced Binary Search:
The purpose of binary search is to divide possible solutions into half, the detailed procedure is as follow:
1) estimate the range of results: what is the upperbound ? what is the lowerbound ?
2) guess the possible solution within the estimated range: always get the middle of the range
3) establish examination condition to check if guessed result is valid: according to the object of the question
4) Adjust estimated range according to the results of examination condition test: either move forward or backward

when should we use binary search ? we can estimate the range of solution and the question is to ask some optimal case(max/min) within
the estimated range

Several sample code of while loop in binary search:
1) exit when both upperbound and lowerbound are the same, the upperbound is never reachable thus we need to make end+1 to make sure
the biggest upperbound we can get is the reachable value !! The goal is the get the biggest one that is smaller than target
while st < end:
 mid = int((st + end) / 2)
 if mid < target:
  st = mid + 1
 else:
  end = mid
return st - 1

2) exit when both upperbound and lowerbound are the same, the upperbound is always reachable. The goal is to get the smallest one
that is bigger than target
while st < end:
 mid = int((st + end) / 2)
 if mid > target:
  end = mid
 else:
  st = mid + 1
return st

3) exit when upperbound is less than lowerbound, the result has to be one single point within the range. This usually running
slower than 1) and 2)
while st <= end:
 mid = int((st + end) / 2)
 if mid > target:
  end = mid - 1
 elif mid < target:
  st = mid + 1
 else:
  return mid
  
 4) exit when there is just two points st and end, there have to be three points within the range at least, usually applicable to
  non-integer operation
  while st + 1 < end:
   mid = (st + end) / 2
   if mid < target:
    st = mid
   else:
    end = mid
  return st
  
  Application I: find the duplicated number between 1 and n, the length of input array is between 1 and n + 1
  analysis: 1) Since the range of duplicated number is between 1 and n 2) the condition is that there is a duplicated one in the 
  array. Thus we can use binary search to solve it
  while loop strategy: the smallest one that is bigger than target
  
  Application II: Wood cut, given n picecs of length of wood, cut them into pieces with equal length from n picecs that have to
  be bigger than or equal to k, find the longgest length of each k piece
  analysis: 1) Since the range of the length of each piece is between 1 and max(picecs), let res be length of our result
  2) the condition is sum([int(piece/res) for piece in pieces]) >= k. Thus we can use binary search to solve it
  while loop strategy: the biggest one that is smaller than target(remember to let end + 1 !!)
  
  Application III: Copy Books, given n book pages and we have k person, each person can only consecutive books in the pages array
  assuming 1 page takes 1 minute, find the minimal minute to finish reading all n pages by k person
  analysis: 1) Since the range of minutes is between min(pages) and sum(pages), let res be minimal minutes takes to complete
  2) let a[i] be each person's allocation minutes to finish reading allocated books, the condition is sum(a[i] where i in 1..k)
  is equals to sum(pages) and res = max(a[i] where i in 1..k) to be minimize
  while loop strategy: the smallest one that is bigger than target
  
  Application IV: Find peak element I, given n elements find the peak index such that p[i-1] < p[i] > p[i+1]
  analysis: 1) the peak element index is within range from 0 to len(p)-1 2) the condition is that p[i-1] < p[i] > p[i+1]
  while loop strategy: single point
  
  Application V: First Bad Version, given n element, once there is a code version bad, all following version will become bad
  as well, our goal is to find the first one that is False
  analysis: 1) the result index is between 1 and n 2) the condition is to find the first False
  while loop stragegy: the smallest one that is bigger than target
  
  Application VI: Find peak element II, given a matrix that outermost rows/columns are always smaller than inner rows/columns
  find the index of the peak element such that p[i-1][j] < p[i][j] & p[i+1][j] < p[i][j] & p[i][j-1] < p[i][j] & p[i][j+1] < p[i][j]
  analysis: 1) the range of index is within matrix 2) the condition is as above
  while loop strategy: we get the mid of rows to find the maximum columns,i+1/i-1 rows in the same column bigger than maximum 
  columns will contains peak(up/down), thus we cut matrix into half according to rows vertically and we get the mid of columns 
  to find the maximum row in vertical and j+1/j-1 columns in the same row bigger than maximum rows will contains peak(left/right),
  thus we cut matrix into half according to column horizontally. Combing, we get a quarter of target area
  the termination principle is single point
  
  Application VII: Divide two integers, given two integers, without multipli0 cation/divide/module to get result of division in
  integer
  analysis:1) the range of result is between 0 and dividend 2) the condition is res * divisor + remain == dividend where remain
  is less than divisor
  while loop strategy: we use bit operation to perform multiplication: a << c is equal to a * pow(2,c) and start from bit 31 to
  bit 0
  for i in range(end,-1,-1): #end is 31
            if remain + (divisor << i) <= dividend:
                remain += divisor << i
                quotient += pow(2,i)
                
 Application VIII: sqrt(x) II, perform square root on double digits
 analysis:1) the range of sqrt(x) is between 0 to x 2) let res be sqrt(x), res*res <= x
 while loop strategy: the triple strategy 
 while st < end - base:
            mid = (st + end) / 2
            if mid * mid >= x:
                end = mid
            else:
                st = mid
  return st

 while loop strategy: the biggest one that is smaller than target
 while st <= end:
            mid = int((st+end)/2)
            if mid * mid < x:
                st = mid + 1
            elif mid * mid > x:
                end = mid - 1
            else:
                return mid
        return st - 1
        
 Application X: Smallest Rectangle Enclosing Black Pixels, given a position i,j of a index which value is 1 in a binary matrix,
 there is only one black region that connects with each block points vertically and horizontally, find the smallest rectangle
 area that contains all black points
 analysis: 1) we need to find the four extreme points of the rectangle, they all within binary matrix 2) the condition is that
 we start stretching from given position in up/down/left/right four directions, in up/left direction we find the first "1" from
 st(lower) to end(upper) direction, which applies the smallest one that is bigger than target while loop strategy; in down/right
 direction we find the last "1" from st(lower) to end(upper) direction, which applies the biggest one that is smaller than target
 (note let end + 1)
 while low < high:
            mid = int((low + high) / 2)
            if ((is_vertical == True and "1" in image[mid][min:max]) or (is_horizontal == True and "1" in [image[x][mid] for x in range(min,max)])) and is_upleft == True:
                high = mid 
            elif ((is_vertical == True and "1" in image[mid][min:max]) or (is_horizontal == True and "1" in [image[x][mid] for x in range(min,max)])) and is_upleft == False:
                low = mid + 1
            elif ((is_vertical == True and "1" not in image[mid][min:max]) or (is_horizontal == True and "1" not in [image[x][mid] for x in range(min,max)])) and is_upleft == True:
                low = mid + 1
            elif ((is_vertical == True and "1" not in image[mid][min:max]) or (is_horizontal == True and "1" not in [image[x][mid] for x in range(min,max)])) and is_upleft == False:
                high = mid
        if is_upleft == True:
            return low #this strategy we can get the end value
        else:
            return low - 1 #this strategy we cannot get the end value, thus we need to make high + 1
stretch from four directions:
max_row, max_col = len(image), len(image[0])
            lowest_row = self.binary_stretch(image, 0, x, 0, max_col, True, False, True)
            highest_row = self.binary_stretch(image, x+1, max_row, 0, max_col, True, False, False)
            left_col = self.binary_stretch(image, 0, y, lowest_row, highest_row+1, False, True, True)
            right_col = self.binary_stretch(image, y+1, max_col, lowest_row, highest_row+1, False, True, False)
            return (highest_row - lowest_row + 1) * (right_col - left_col + 1)

Application XI: Maximum Average Subarray II, given an array, find the subarray with the maximum average with length >= k
analysis: 1) the maximum average is between min(array) and max(array) 2) the condition is that we have to check if the given
array have such subarray whose average is >= estimated average
while loop strategy: since we are allowed to have some degree of inaccuracy, we can use triple strategy on float
The trick is to determine if given array has a subarray whose average is bigger than or equal to the estimated average
Below is how we achieve this:
for i in range(len(nums)):
 nums[i] -= average #we minus average, so that we just need to find if there is subarray whose sum is bigger or equal to 0 !!
sum_array, sum_part, min_before = 0, 0, 
for i in range(k):
 sum_array += nums[i]
if sum_array >= 0:
 return True
#This is how we determine if there exsits a subarray with length >= k, its sum is bigger than or equal to zero !!! 
for i in range(k,len(nums)):
 sum_array += nums[i]
 sum_part += nums[i-k]
 min_before = min(min_before, sum_part)
 if sum_array - min_before >= 0: #sum_array is the maximum sum value of subarray with length >= k
  return True
return False
        
 Then, we use triple strategy to get our result in while loop manner:
 while st < end - base: #ase is 1e-8 which is the degree of precision
  mid = (end + st) / 2
  if self.check_ifbiggest(mid, nums, k) == False:
   end = mid            
  else:
   st = mid
 return st
