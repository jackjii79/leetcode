python knowledge:
1 how to sort with multiple keys:
data.sort(key=lambda item: (item[1], item[0]), reverse=True)
here, item[1] is the primary key and item[0] is the secondary key
if we want to sort keys in different directions(increasing/decreasing) we can just use negative, like
data.sort(key=lambda item: (item[1], 0-item[0]), reverse=True) we sort item[1] in increasing and item[0] in decreasing if ties occur
