When consider the problem of graph, given nodes and their associated nodes(edge), we need to consider the case that
when the node is a isolated one, which means no associated edges can be founded !!!
If the requirement is to return the list of connected component like [[a,b,c],[d,e],...], we should use a dict() firstly to store 
all nodes as key and its value is the key iteself to avoid missing those isolated nodes as a special case of connected components
